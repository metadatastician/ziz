# Pipeline: extract-clauses.sh + extract-facts.sh (Kennel: sense) -> coapt.ncl
# (Yard: compare, pure) -> write receipts/latest.a2ml (Hunt: actuate, leashed).
#
# Modes (runner-invocation grammar):
#   --report   (default) SITREP — emit the coaptation receipt; decide nothing.
#   --reanchor           If the band is red, assemble the BASIS for an anchor-drop
#                        (the "carnage"). The DROP ITSELF is a human authority act —
#                        coapt never drops an anchor. ANCHOR.a2ml has no drift/ledger
#                        schema yet, so the drop cannot be recorded mechanically.

# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — test entry point (julia-library archetype)
#
# Two suites, in this order:
#   1. Aqua package-shape gate — runs FIRST: a package that does not load
#      cleanly, whose deps are not compat-closed, or whose exports are
#      ambiguous is rejected before any behaviour test can pass.
#   2. Behaviour — every test/cases/*.jl is included. The shipped case
#      (smoke.jl) is a LOAD check only; replace/extend it as real
#      behaviour tests land. Until then, `Pkg.test()` passing is necessary
#      but NOT sufficient — record that in STATE.a2ml (smoke-only suite).

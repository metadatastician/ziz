### Repository Structure

The authoritative map is **generated** from the tree and checked in CI, so it
cannot drift:
[`docs/architecture/REPOSITORY-MAP.adoc`](../docs/architecture/REPOSITORY-MAP.adoc).
Regenerate it with `just repo-map`.

A hand-written tree used to live here. It described `lib/`, `extensions/`,
`plugins/` and `spec/` directories that this repository has never contained,
which is precisely why the map is now generated rather than typed.

# check-no-placeholders.sh — no repo may ship an unfilled {{PLACEHOLDER}}.
#
# Estate rule (methodology.a2ml: reject-if-contains): a token that `just repo-init`
# did not fill is debt, and in .github/settings.yml or SECURITY.md it is a
# defect with consequences — probot/settings applies settings.yml on every push,
# and a security policy that cites a key nobody holds is worse than one that
# says "email us".
#
# This is the single implementation of that rule, called from two places:
#   * .github/workflows/openssf-compliance.yml — on the repo as committed
#   * tests/e2e/template_instantiation_test.sh — on a freshly init'd repo,
#     which is where a leak is still cheap to fix
# It exists as a script rather than inline shell in each caller because the
# previous split — a workflow that checked a hand-listed set of files, and an
# e2e test that re-implemented substitution with its own token list — let the
# two drift until the test passed while real instantiation leaked.
#
# Scans every text file and allow-lists the few legitimate carriers, rather
# than checking a list of files someone must remember to extend. The old
# required-files list omitted .github/settings.yml and ANCHOR.a2ml, which is
# precisely where the leaks were.
#
# Matches upper-snake brace tokens only. Justfiles are skipped entirely: an
# ARGS token there is just's own interpolation syntax, not a template token.
# GitHub Actions expressions are ${{ dotted.lower }} and do not match.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no unfilled tokens (or this is a template repo, where tokens are the product)
#   1 — unfilled tokens found
#   2 — usage / setup error

# ─── settings.yml identity guard — runs EVERYWHERE, template repos included ────
#
# This check deliberately precedes the template exemption below. That exemption
# is why the original incident went unseen: the gate skipped `*-template-repo`
# entirely, so nobody noticed that .github/settings.yml shipped `name: "{{REPO}}"`
# — and .github/settings.yml is not inert content in a template. probot/settings
# applies it on every push to the default branch, in the template as much as in
# an instantiation. The template submitted the literal `{{REPO}}` as its own
# name; GitHub collapsed the illegal braces to dashes and renamed the repository
# to `-REPO-`, which then read as a deleted repo.
#
# So: in this one file, a placeholder is never "the product". Neither is an
# identity key with a real value — `name`/`private` cannot be inherited by a
# child repo without being wrong (see the header of .github/settings.yml).

# case: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/defects` gives basename `defects`,
# the exemption misses, and the gate reports every one of the template's ~85
# deliberate placeholder files as a failure. A clone into `rsr-template-repo-2`,
# or any renamed directory, does the same.

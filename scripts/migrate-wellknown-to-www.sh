# migrate-wellknown-to-www.sh — conflict-safe migration of a repository-root
# .well-known/ tree into www/.well-known/ (rsr-template-repo#53).
#
# Stage 1 established the canonical location. Stage 5 (#119) sweeps it across
# ~270 repositories, which changes what "conflict-safe" has to mean: a sweep
# is unattended, so a conflict may not halt it, and may not be silent either.
#
# Semantics, per the #53 migration requirements:
#   * identical content in both locations  -> root copy removed, www kept;
#   * content only at the root             -> moved into www/.well-known/;
#   * content only under www/              -> no-op;
#   * DIVERGENT content in both            -> the ROOT copy is quarantined to
#     www/.legacy-well-known-<YYYYMMDD>/ and the www/ copy is left untouched:
#     never overwritten, never silent. Exit 0 by default so a batch sweep can
#     continue; --strict turns a quarantine into a non-zero exit.
#
# --in-place restores the pre-stage-5 contract (both copies stay where they
# are, exit 1) for anyone who prefers to resolve divergence by hand before the
# tree is touched at all.
#
# Why the quarantine lives under www/ and not at the root:
#   #106's commit message specifies `.legacy-well-known-YYYYMMDD/` at the
#   repository root. The root allowlist (.machine_readable/root-allow.txt) is
#   checked BIDIRECTIONALLY by scripts/check-root-shape.sh and matches entries
#   literally, with no glob support — a root directory whose name carries a
#   date can never be allowlisted, so every swept repository would report root
#   drift the moment the migrator ran. Under www/ it is inside the site-
#   operations bundle the allowlist already permits, and it is NOT under
#   www/public/, so the publication boundary still holds.
#
# Run from the repository root. Uses `git mv`/`git rm` when the tree is a git
# checkout and the files are tracked, plain mv/rm otherwise, so it is safe on
# minted-but-uncommitted trees too. Propagation runners should combine this
# with a `git status --porcelain` / unpushed-commit check of their own; this
# script compares CONTENT, and content comparison is what "divergent" means
# here.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — clean migration (quarantines may have occurred; see the report)
#   1 — divergence left unresolved (--in-place), --strict and something was
#       quarantined, or files unexpectedly remain at the root
#   2 — usage / setup error

Usage: scripts/migrate-wellknown-to-www.sh [options]

Migrate a repository-root .well-known/ into www/.well-known/.

Options:
  --dry-run         report what would change; write nothing (always exit 0)
  --in-place        divergent content stays put, both copies kept, exit 1
                    (pre-stage-5 contract; for hand resolution)
  --strict          exit 1 if anything had to be quarantined
  --report FILE     write a TSV report: action<TAB>path<TAB>detail
  -h, --help        this message

Report actions: moved, deduped, quarantined, conflict, left.

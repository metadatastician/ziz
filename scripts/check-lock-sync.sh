# check-lock-sync.sh — verify .github/workflows/actions.lock is in sync with the
# workflow YAML, in BOTH directions (including job-level reusable-workflow refs),
# AND that the lockfile is TRANSITIVELY CLOSED.
#
# Three clauses, each of which alone is insufficient:
#
#   1. every `uses:` in a workflow is locked under THAT workflow's own path;
#   2. every lockfile entry is still referenced by its workflow (no orphans);
#   3. every ref NAMED anywhere in the lockfile resolves to a top-level
#      `dependencies:` record — the lockfile has no dangling edges.
#
# Clause 3 is not decoration. It is the clause that catches the failure mode that
# clauses 1 and 2 are structurally blind to, and it was added only after that
# blindness was measured. On hyperpolymath/cicd-squabbler, 2026-09-22:
#
#   commit    dangling-edge class                              result
#   fe22bbc   workflows: -> dependencies: (ref listed, no record)   4 workflows startup_failure, jobs=0
#   cfadcf9   dependencies: -> dependencies: (record added, its
#             own nested uses: unrecorded)                          the same 4 still startup_failure
#   5286aa5   none - transitively closed                            0 startup_failure, all 17 runs create jobs
#
# At fe22bbc AND cfadcf9 this script exited 0, `gh actions-lock --verify-local`
# exited 0, and the Lock Sync Gate reported green - while GitHub was refusing to
# start four workflows. Every local gate was green on a fatal commit. That is the
# guard/consumer trap: the gate asked "is every uses: locked?" and GitHub asks
# "is every locked ref RESOLVABLE?".
#
# The asymmetry that makes clause 3 mandatory, and counter-intuitive:
#   * a job-level ref ABSENT from the lockfile entirely is HARMLESS;
#   * a ref PRESENT in the lockfile but unresolvable is FATAL.
# So adding entries without closing them is strictly worse than adding nothing.
# Clause 1 demands entries be added; only clause 3 makes that demand safe. Shipping
# clause 1 without clause 3 actively steers a developer into the fatal state:
# Dependabot bumps a job-level ref -> clause 1 reds -> `gh actions-lock` is blind to
# job-level refs and will not backfill -> the developer hand-adds the workflows:
# entry to get green -> no dependencies: record -> CI dies silently, gate green.
#
# Exit 0 only when all three clauses hold. Any violation exits 1. There is no
# warn-only mode: a desync means GitHub refuses to start the run, so it must fail
# the job. A `::warning::` cannot fail a job and would be a vacuous gate.

# check-root-shape.sh — enforce the canonical root shape, in BOTH directions,
# against the repository root allowlist, under EITHER canonical spelling:
#   .machine_readable/root-allow.txt  (dotted, CANONICAL ESTATE-WIDE)
#   machine-readable/root-allow.txt   (hyphenated, accepted legacy)
#
# The dotted form is the standard (owner ruling 2026-09-17; estate census 48
# repos dotted vs 9 hyphenated). The hyphenated form is still RESOLVED, not
# rejected, because the checker is shared with repos that have not migrated.
# Removing this branch would turn 9 working gates into exit-2 setup errors.
#
#   * an entry at root that is not listed          -> drift (extra)
#   * a listed entry WITHOUT '?' that is missing   -> drift (missing)
#
# The second direction was absent until 2026-08, and its absence is why the
# allowlist rotted: it accumulated 19 permissions for files the April root
# cleanup had already moved into docs/, and nothing could ever notice. A
# one-directional allowlist only ratchets open, so over time it licenses
# exactly the drift it was written to prevent.
#
# '?' marks an entry that is legitimately absent in some conforming repo —
# template-only material removed at mint, or a capability-gated module.
#
# Companion to scripts/validate-template.sh: that script enforces required
# files; this one enforces the shape as a whole.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — root matches allowlist
#   1 — drift (extras at root, or required entries missing)
#   2 — usage / setup error
